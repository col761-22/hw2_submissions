Files and Instructions to Run:

The files and libraries for Q1, Q2 and Q3 are present in folder named Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively.

Q1:

- data_format_converter.cpp
    - this file reads the yeast dataset and generates proper input format files for gSpan, PAFI and gaston.
    usage:
        g++ data_format_converter.cpp -o data_format_converter
        ./data_format_converter <path_to_yeast_input_file>

- run_algos.sh
    - this file runs the 
    - assumes data_format_converter.cpp has been run and generated files are present in the same directory.
    usage: ./run_algos.sh

- plot_script.py
    - this helper file is called by run_algos.sh and it parses the timing files generated by run_algos.sh to generate the comparision plot.
    usage: python3 plot_script.py <plot_name_without_png>
    example usage: python3 plot_script.py "timings_on_yeast"

- timings_on_yeast.png
    - the generated 'frequent subgraph mining time' vs threshold for the three algos.

Q2:

- vf2lib
    - this directory contains the source code for vf2 library used in subgraph isomorphism.

- index.sh
    - this file takes input dataset and converts into index and also stores graphs and patterns in vf2 input format.
    - usage: ./index.sh <path_to_input_dataset>

- query.sh
    - this files interactively asks for the path of query graphs and runs the matching algo. with graphs in the database.
    - run this after running index.sh.
    - usage: ./query.sh

    Helper Files:

- data_format_converter.cpp
    - similar to that in Q1. used to convert graphs to gspan format.

- index.cpp
    - this file does the feature vector generation for database graphs and stores them in feature_vectors.txt.
 
- gspan_data_format_to_vf2
    - this file does converts database graphs and patterns into vf2 input format.

- query.cpp
    - this file is called by query.sh to do the query processing and matching on the database using feature vector pruning and subgraph isomorphism checks.

Q3:

- elbow_plot.sh
    - this is the required elbow_plot.sh
    usage: sh elbow_plot.sh <dataset> <dimension> <plot_name>
    example usage: sh elbow_plot.sh CS1190344_generated_dataset_3D.dat 3 q3_3_CS1190344.png

- generate_elbow_plot.py
    - this helper file is called by elbow_plot.sh
    usage: python3 generate_elbow_plot.py <input_dataset_file> <dimension> <plot_name>
    example usage: python3 generate_elbow_plot.py CS1190344_generated_dataset_3D.dat 3 q3_3_CS1190344.png

- q3_<dim>_CS1190344.png
    - the generated elbow plot for dimension = <dim> dataset.
